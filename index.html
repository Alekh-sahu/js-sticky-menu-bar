    <p>A false friend might push you to change for them. Fake friends might give you the feedback you want rather than
      the words that will actually help
      you. A true friend acknowledges your feelings but at the same time points you towards a happier, healthier life. A true friend is not complacent in
      your personal growth; they don’t passively sit by and watch you make choices that are not good for you. Real friends listen to you when you talk
      about your feelings, your ideas about the world, and what brings you joy. A friend is someone who gives you encouragement to make the choice that
      will get you to want in life. Friends learn the art of being your biggest cheerleader while holding you accountable to your goals as well.
      Spending time with a trustworthy friend makes you feel compelled to make the choices that feel right to you, speak your truth, and live to the
      best of your ability. Laughing with a great friend can help you forget about your troubles, and you can listen to them talk about theirs.

      True Friendship Doesn’t Abandon You

      Fairweather friends are with you when you’re happy and successful. Then, in tough times, when things become challenging for you, these friends feel compelled
      to move on to the next happy, successful person. A real friend, on the other hand, stays with you through traumas, disappointments, mental health crises,
      and physical illnesses. They don’t abandon you just because it’s easier or more comfortable to avoid you. Because a true friend truly cares about you,
      they actually want to be there for you during your difficult times. They care more about what you are going through more than they care about how fun
      you are. A friend isn’t around simply for the things or good times you have in your life — they are around for you! Friends want to hear about your
      relationships, school and work, ideas, and your family. So when your life gets more challenging and you find yourself feeling pretty down or
      overwhelmed, you won’t have to go through these challenges alone with a true friend in your corner.
      you might want to spend time with people who are different from you in ways that challenge you to grow as a person. If your current friends let you
      down, redefining true friendship can open the door to a rich, rewarding relationship.

      You might ask yourself questions about friendship, like, What are the signs of true friendship? What is a true best friend? What are the five qualities of
      true friendship? What factors define true friendship? What is perfect friendship? How do you become a true friend? What's the difference
      between a real friend and a true friend? What's the difference between a good friend and a true friend? What is a friendship symbol for best friend? What
      does pure friendship mean?

      Much like our personal styles, we all may have different needs and desires when coming to friendship. You may also come to recognize that some differences
      are able to support you in some areas of life while you may have another friend that you rely on for support in another area of your life. Expanding the
      friendships that make up your support system can help ensure that your needs are adequately being met. No friend is perfect, and no friend will be able to
      be everything to you. Even true friends will sometimes disappoint us. What matters most is how they respond to your feelings and the patterns they establish
      in their relationships. We all need the support of friends in our lives. Have the disappointments you are experiencing in your friendship become habits? A
      true friend cares about you. They're able to have concern and respect for your thoughts and emotions even when they may not agree. If the disappointment
      you are experiencing in a friendship has become consistent, it may be time to redefine your definition of a true friend.

      Talking to a professional therapist can help you understand where you are going wrong as you choose your friends. The therapist can offer you a sound
      psychological basis for recognizing and nurturing the friendships that will improve your life and bring you happiness and peace now and in the future.
      It only takes a moment to reach out for help. When you do, you can start your journey towards satisfying friendships with real friends.
